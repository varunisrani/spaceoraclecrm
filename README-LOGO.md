# Space Oracle Logo Setup Instructions

The Space Oracle logo is now configured to be loaded directly from an external URL:

```
https://i.ibb.co/d02GFpsf/space.png
```

## Implementation Details

1. The Navbar component has been updated to use this external image URL:
   ```tsx
   <Image 
     src="https://i.ibb.co/d02GFpsf/space.png" 
     alt="Space Oracle Logo" 
     width={180} 
     height={48} 
     priority
     className="object-contain"
   />
   ```

2. The Next.js configuration has been updated to allow images from the ibb.co domain:
   ```ts
   // next.config.ts
   images: {
     domains: ['i.ibb.co'],
   },
   ```

This approach eliminates the need to manually save the logo locally in the project.
